### Author: Sydney Clough

A program that takes the name of an input file, search string, and output file name.

Then the program:
* Outputs to stdout the size of the file
* Outputs to stdout the number of times the search string occurs within the input file
* Copies the contents of the input file to an output file with the file name specified

The program can handle search strings or files that contain binary characters.

### To compile:
`make`

### To run:
`./count <input-filename> <search-string> <output-filename>`
